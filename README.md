# Dog Breed Classification

This project uses deep learning to classify dog breeds from images using a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 model.

## Objective

The goal is to accurately identify the breed of a dog from an image by leveraging convolutional neural networks and transfer learning techniques.

## Techniques Used

- TensorFlow / Keras framework
- MobileNetV2 pretrained on ImageNet
- Transfer learning with fine-tuning
- Data augmentation to improve model robustness
- Target accuracy: above 80%

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for training, evaluation, and experimentation
- `data/`: Dataset folder (not included in this repository)
- `models/`: Saved model files and weights
- `README.md`: Project documentation
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and folders to ignore

## Dataset

The dataset contains thousands of labeled images of different dog breeds. To avoid large file sizes in this repository, the dataset itself is not included.

You can download the dataset from the following sources:
- [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/)

Place the downloaded data inside the `data/` folder with the following subfolders:
- `train/`
- `test/`

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately XX% on the validation dataset after fine-tuning.

## Future Work

- Deploy the model as a web or mobile application
- Extend the model to include more dog breeds
- Experiment with ensemble models to improve accuracy
- Optimize model performance and reduce inference time
